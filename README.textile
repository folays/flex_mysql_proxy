h1. flex_mysql_proxy

A MySQL Proxy with Dynamic Redirection.

It extract the _"username"_ and _"db"_ from the first client packet.

Then it asprintf("%s.sql.example.net") and connect to this backend, and thus forwards between the client and the backend.

h1. Usage

<pre>
pmake re [proxy_port=3307] && ./flex_mysql_proxy
</pre>

You have to have an /etc/flex_mysql_proxy/scripts/proxy.lua:
<pre>
function get_backend_from_username(username, db)
   return db..".sql.example.net", "3306"
   end
   </pre>

This script should return the backend IP, or whatever is supported by getaddrinfo() like a hostname.

It listen on the port 3307 by default.

h1. Caveats

I am not a magician. This could not work with _"mysql_native_password"_ authentication due to the challenge-response (there is some sort of a scramble).

You have to use _*"--enable-cleartext-plugin"*_ which means that the backend is allowed to re-request the password in plain text.

It works:
* with plaintext authentication (https://github.com/folays/mysql_auth_flex)
* could work for PAM & co
* could work with minimal modifications where we can discard and not considering the first backend packet (no challenge to be forcibly answered)

<pre>
folays@phenix:~$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --port 3307--user=username --enable-cleartext-plugin --password=password
</pre>
